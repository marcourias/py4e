#  7.2 Write a program that prompts for a file name, then opens that file and reads through the file, 
# looking for lines of the form:

# X-DSPAM-Confidence:    0.8475

# Count these lines and extract the floating point values from each of the lines and
# compute the average of those values and produce an output as shown below. 
# Do not use the sum() function or a variable named sum in your solution.

# You can download the sample data at http://www.py4e.com/code3/mbox-short.txt 
# when you are testing below enter mbox-short.txt as the file name.
